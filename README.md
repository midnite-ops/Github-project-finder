## What i learnt from this project

As a developer, learning new concepts or syntax can most times be scary but thats why building projects is always the right step. In this project i used my knowledge of fetching APIs to create an application where users can search for github repositories, i learnt several concepts like 'try and catch, async and await' but although in did'nt use them in the project, i understood their importance when dealing with asynchronous code. On to the next. Here is the link to the project https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-random-repo


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
